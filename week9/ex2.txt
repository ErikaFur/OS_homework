for n = 10

with sequence: 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 5 6
output is:
miss ratio 0.333333
hit ratio 0.666667
it is because we have 15 entities and 5 of them are unique
minimal possible miss ratio is (count of unique entities)/all ticks

with sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
output is:
miss ratio 1.000000
hit ratio 0.000000
